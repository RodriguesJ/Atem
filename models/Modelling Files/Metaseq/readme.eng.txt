 This version doesn't contain a uninstaller. You have only to delete 
all files.


Direct3D:
 DirectX 8.0 or later must be installed for using the preview of 
Direct3D. The DirectX runtime isn't included in this software, so you 
need to get and install it from the Microsoft DirectX web site.
 It isn't able to use Direct3D on WindowsNT 4.0 because WindowsNT 4.0 
doesn't support DirectX 8.0 or later.


OpenGL:
 If your cannot use the preview of OpenGL because of 
"SetPixelFormat() error", check "Reserve DLL" in the configuration.


 If you have some troubles by using Direct3D or OpenGL, you should 
get the latest driver of a display adapter because an old driver may 
have some bugs.
